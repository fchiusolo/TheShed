# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Shed is a website representing a small workshop where independent software projects are built. The site is intentionally minimal and content-first, serving as an entry point to understand The Shed and navigate to individual project pages.

**Current Status**: The repository is in its early stages with no codebase implementation yet. The website currently serves only a full-screen image as a work-in-progress placeholder.

## Design Principles

When implementing features for this website, adhere to these core principles:

- **Minimal structure**: Keep the architecture simple and lightweight
- **Calm, readable design**: Avoid attention-grabbing elements or growth-driven patterns
- **Content-first**: Prioritize substance over decoration
- **No unnecessary storytelling or marketing content**: Be direct and clear
- **The site should feel like a quiet workshop door that is slightly open**

## Planned Structure

The website will eventually include:

1. **Home**: Brief introduction to The Shed and how things are built here
2. **Projects**: List of applications built in The Shed with descriptions, links to stores/repositories, and dedicated project pages
3. **Project pages**: Individual pages focused on what each project does and why it exists
4. **Contact**: Simple contact mechanism for questions, feedback, or collaborations

## Philosophy

The Shed is not a startup, agency, or brand. It's a place where small, useful tools are built and released independently. All implementation decisions should reflect this quiet, workshop-like mindset.
