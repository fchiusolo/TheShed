# The Shed — Website

This repository contains the source code for **The Shed** website.

The website represents *The Shed* as a place:  
a small workshop where independent software projects are built.

At the moment, the site is intentionally minimal.  
It currently serves a single full-screen image as a quiet “work in progress” signal while things are being built behind the scenes.


## What this website is

The Shed website is meant to be:

- A simple entry point to understand what The Shed is
- A place to list projects built in The Shed
- A way to navigate to individual project pages
- A lightweight contact point for questions or collaborations

The goal is clarity, not marketing.


## Current status

- The homepage displays a full-screen image
- No navigation, content, or interaction yet
- Acts as a placeholder while the structure is being designed

This is intentional.


## Planned structure

The website will eventually include:

### Home
- A brief introduction to The Shed
- A short description of how things are built here

### Projects
- A list of applications built in The Shed
- Each project with:
  - A short description
  - Links to stores / repositories
  - A dedicated project page

### Project pages
- One page per project
- Focused on what the project does and why it exists
- No unnecessary storytelling or marketing content

### Contact
- A simple way to get in touch
- For questions, feedback, or potential collaborations


## Design principles

The website follows a few simple ideas:

- Minimal structure
- Calm, readable design
- Content-first
- No attention-grabbing elements
- No growth-driven patterns

The site should feel like a quiet workshop door that is slightly open.


## Philosophy

The Shed is not a startup, agency, or brand in the traditional sense.  
It is a place where small, useful tools are built and released independently.

The website reflects that mindset.


## Status

This repository — like The Shed itself — is a work in progress.

Things will be added when they are ready.
