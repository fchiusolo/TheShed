# Claude Instructions (MANDATORY)

You are working on a small MVP web page.
Your role is to implement, not to redesign or expand.

## Technology stack (MANDATORY)

- Plain HTML
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Vanilla JavaScript only
- No frameworks
- No build tools
- No backend
- Must work as a static page opened locally

## Absolute constraints

You MUST NOT:
- add features that are not explicitly requested
- suggest improvements or future ideas
- generate or invent content
- infer missing data
- use images, maps, or external APIs
- introduce AI-generated text
- overengineer structure or logic

If something is not specified, **leave it out**.

## Data handling

- Reality Checks will be provided manually as static JSON
- Some sections may have insufficient data
- If data is insufficient, the UI must NOT fabricate or “fill” content
- Missing data must result in sections being hidden or a clear “no data” state

## UI philosophy

- Calm
- Minimal
- Readable
- Trustworthy

Clarity is more important than polish.

## Tone

- Adult
- Direct but elegant
- Honest
- Never sarcastic or defensive

If you are unsure about something, choose the simplest implementation.
