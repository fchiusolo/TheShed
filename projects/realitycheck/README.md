# Reality Check – MVP Web

This project is a **small, deliberately constrained MVP**.

Its purpose is to let real people try a core product idea:
helping travelers make **more conscious decisions** when they already have doubts about a specific place.

This is not a production app.
This is not a travel guide.
This is a validation tool.

## What problem we are exploring

Many travelers waste time, energy, or even put themselves in uncomfortable situations because:
- expectations are built on social media
- negative or critical information is scattered and hard to extract
- understanding “what could go wrong” takes hours of research

This MVP tests whether **structured, honest “Reality Checks”** reduce:
- decision anxiety
- wasted time
- regret after the fact

## What a “Reality Check” is

A Reality Check is **not a recommendation**.

It is a short, structured summary that focuses on:
- expectation vs reality
- hidden costs (time, energy, stress)
- context where the experience degrades
- who a place is *not* a good fit for

Sometimes the most honest outcome is:
> “We don’t have enough reliable information to say anything useful.”

That outcome is intentional and valuable.

## Target users (early)

This MVP is designed for people who:
- travel independently
- have already had at least one disappointing stop
- want clarity without spending hours researching
- prefer honesty over hype

It is **not** designed for:
- inspiration or discovery
- impulsive, hype-driven decisions
- people looking for itineraries or suggestions

---

## Strategy

This MVP exists to validate:
- the *moment of use* (when doubt appears)
- the *mental relief* it provides
- the clarity of the format

It does **not** aim to validate:
- market size
- growth
- monetization
- technical scalability

If the idea works, everything else comes later.
